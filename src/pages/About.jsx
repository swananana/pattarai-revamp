      <h4>What is PATTARAI</h4>
      <p>
        Pattarai is a group of aspiring engineers led by experienced engineers
        who meet together to share ideas and work on new projects. We research,
        teach, learn, and construct innovative technology. Pattarai is a project
        club that provides students with the modern technical skills they need
        to succeed in the workplace. Students are encouraged to learn by
        completing real-world projects. We've been working on turning ideas into
        reality for the past year and a half. More than 40 students participated
        in the project, which resulted in the creation of 16 new initiatives and
        the holding of nine events. We desire to bring a change being the
        change!
